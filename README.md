- 👀 I’m interested in entirely too many things to keep track of, and not nearly enough to satisfy my thirst...for knowledge, not OnlyFans!!! Crypto has been my focus recently, but I'm also an electronics engineer, web developer, and an entrepreneur and machinist/woodworker/maker of cool sh*t.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, DeFi development, programming trading bots in python, among other things...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is able to pique my interest. Lets see what we can come up with! 
- 📫 How to reach me:   degenknight@outlook.com or send me a text at (669)241-5165‬
